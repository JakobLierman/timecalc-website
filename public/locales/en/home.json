  "description": "Ever stood in front of your dishwasher, calculating by how much you should delay the washing program for it to finish at 7 in the morning? You used your big brain, entered the amount and went to sleep. All that extra effort only to find out the next day that you were completely wrong.\n\nTimeCalc does all the hard work four you. Just enter your duration of the program, when you want it to finish and how accurate your delay function is. You'll see the result at the bottom.\n\nLess effort by you, always the correct amount of delay.",
